                    <li><strong>1859</strong> - Nikola Tesla is born in Smiljan, Croatia </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1870</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
                        University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as
                        the "National Youth Administration"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1935</strong> - Nikola Tesla moved to a place known as Karlovac to complete his high
                        school.
                        Three years later, he went back to Smiljan and shortly after his arrival; he contracted cholera.
                        He
                        was in hospital for close to one year, and he faced near-death circumstances.

                    <li>
                        <strong>1875</strong> - Tesla Enrolls In College
                        In 1875, Tesla enrolled to a Polytechnic based on a military scholarship. He was a disciplined
                        student and achieved the highest grades possible while passing various exams.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1880</strong> - Tesla's uncle collected money to help him relocate to Prague to finish
                        his
                        studies. He arrived late to enroll for classes, and his lack of competence in Greek and Czech
                        meant
                        that he did not qualify for the classes he wanted to take. Instead, he took up classes in
                        Philosophy
                        at the university, though he did not receive grades for the courses..

                        <strong>1881</strong> - Tesla Begins His Career As Chief Electrical Engineer
                        In 1881, he moved to Budapest in Hungary, to work for a telegraph company. Upon arriving, he
                        noticed
                        that the Budapest Telephone Exchange company was not in operation, so he worked at draftsman in
                        another company. A few months later, the BTS Company was in operation, and he was given the
                        position
                        of chief electrical engineer. During his tenure, he introduced various operation upswings which
                        improved the performance of the company.

                    <li>
                        <strong>1882</strong> - Tesla Goes To Work For Edison
                        In 1882, he found another job in Paris with a company referred to as the Continental Edison
                        Company.
                        He began working in a new industry by installing indoor lighting resources. His company had
                        several
                        divisions, and he worked in the section of the company that was responsible for lighting systems

                    <li>
                        <strong>1885</strong> - Tesla Submits Some Of His First Patents
                        In March 1885, he met with an attorney known as Lemuel Serrel, to help in the submission of
                        various
                        patents. Serrel introduced Tesla to various businessmen, including Benjamin Vail and Robert
                        Lane.
                        They agreed to help finance a new light production company under Tesla Name. Tesla worked to
                        acquire
                        the patents for the company including developing an enhanced DC motor. His solutions gained
                        attention from the mass media who sought his solutions.

                    <li>
                        <strong>1887</strong> - Tesla Re-imagines The Electric Motor
                        In 1887, Tesla came up with an induction motor that was operated by alternating current, a form
                        of
                        power that was becoming common in Europe and the USA. This type of power provided various
                        benefits,
                        especially in long-distance power transmission. In particular, the motor was operated by a
                        polyphase
                        current, which produced a rotating magnetic field to operate the motor. This innovative electric
                        motor was patented in May 1988, and it comprised of a basic self-starting design that did not
                        require the use of commutators. As a result, this reduced the occurrence of sparking the high
                        maintenance that was associated with replacing mechanical brushes.

                        <strong>1890</strong> - Tesla Begins His Work On Wireless Power Transmission
                        After 1890, Tesla researched various approaches to transmitting power by inductive and
                        capacitive
                        coupling. This was through the use of AC voltages that were produced by his famous `Tesla coil.`
                        He
                        tried in many ways to come up with a wireless lighting system that was based on near field and
                        capacitative coupling. He even performed various public demonstrations, where he would light up
                        Geissler tubes to impress his audience. Tesla also spent close to well over a decade trying to
                        come
                        up with new solutions for lighting.

                        <strong>1891</strong> - Tesla Patents The Tesla Coil
                        In mid 1891, at the age of 35, he became a naturalized citizen of the US. In the same year, he
                        also
                        patented his famous Tesla Coil.

                        <strong>1943</strong> - Tesla's Death
                        In early 1943, at age 86, Tesla died in a Hotel Room in New York. He died alone, and his body
                        was
                        found by a maid who ignored a do not disturb sign on Tesla's room.
